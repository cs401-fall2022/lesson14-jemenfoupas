       <p>TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top 
        of these: TypeScript’s type system. For example, JavaScript provides language 
        primitives like string and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently 
        assigned these. TypeScript does.</p>

       <p>With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones. 
        There are two popular ways to do so: with unions, and with generics.</p>

        <p>With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types. 
          For example, you can describe a Boolean type as being either true or false:</p>

        <p>A popular use-case for union types is to describe the set of string or number
